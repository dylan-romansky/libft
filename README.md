This was one of the first projects we did. It started small, with a handful of basic functions from the standard C libraries that we were supposed to reproduce, then grew larger and larger as we completed further projects and thought of other functions we could create that would be useful. This library was the backbone of most of our other projects, being used in place of the standard C library functions, as our school had a strong belief that we should know exactly what is happening "under the hood" when we're coding and the best way to demonstrate that was to have home-made functions we could show.
